# Introduction

RNAmotiFold is a python wrapper for a set of RNA secondary structure prediction algorithms that implement RNA 3D motifs into RNA secondary structure predictions. 
It is designed to ease the burden of installation of the Bellman's GAP compiler and the setup and usage of the algorithms. Available algorithms are a default motif implementation, a motified RNAshapes version aswell as a motified RNAHeliCes version. Classifications can also be used with a partition function implementations and with suboptimal folding.
